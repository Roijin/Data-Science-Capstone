Travel Dashboard in the age covid

With everyone being stuck at home for the pass year, a lot of people are getting anxious to go outside
I aim to make Dashboard to show areas where there are a large variety of hangout spots, good cell service, and also give a general warning about the virus situation in the area

This is to ensure that people have a more complete overview to the areas they are travelling to before commiting and enables them to be better prepared
